# 5-Day-Weather-Forecast


## DESCRIPTION

This is a Weather Forecast app that gives searched city forecasts for up to five days.  It was created to improve my familiarity with "fetch" requests in JavaScript.  



## USAGE

[Link to Weather Forecast Page](https://yajiit.github.io/5-Day-Weather-Forecast/index.html)
To get a weather forecast, type the desired city into the search bar.  The current forecast should be displayed above the others, while up to five days of forecasts are present below.  When a city name is successfully searched it is added to the Search History.  Up to five previous cities will be saved as buttons to quickly search again.  If there is a city in Search History when the page is loaded the most recently searched history will have its current forecast displayed.


## FEATURES

- 5 day Weather forecasts for any searched city
- Store up to five previously searched cities in Search History
- Displays most recently searched city on page load
- Dynamic background changes color based on current forecast
